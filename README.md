To install this package from source:

Mac users will have to download the necessary tools from the Xcode and its related command line tools (found within Xcode's Preference Pane under Downloads/Components); most Linux distributions should already have up to date compilers (or if not they can be updated easily).

*  Install the devtools package (if necessary), and install the package from the Github source code. 

install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github("miguel-sorrel/cdcatR")  

A stable version of cdcatR should be shortly available at CRAN.
