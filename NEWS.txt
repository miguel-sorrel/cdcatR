cdcat 1.0.0:

* CDM package accepted
* several item selection rules included: GDI, JSD, MPWKL, PWKL, NPS, random (argument itemSelect)
* nonparametric CD-CAT included (itemSelect = "NPS")
	* different arguments available: gate, pseudo.prob, w.type, and seed (argument NPS.args). pseudo.prob and w.type are experimental
	* some arguments needed to be modified / included (e.g., Q is required with nonparametric CD-CAT)
* parallelization included (argument n.cores)
* some warning / error messages included
* information regarding multiple modes (for ML and MAP) included in the output
* i.print is a deprecated argument. When parallelizing, no information is printed
* updated information and references
* new example for the nonparametric CD-CAT included
* model comparison example has been modified (now using the function LR2_step)
* see 2inprogress > AuxFunsAndPacks.R for auxiliary funcions and packages required

att.plot:

* CDM package accepted
* nonparametric CD-CAT accepted
* k argument included for selecting the attributes to be plotted. If k = NULL (by default), all attributes are plotted
* color has been added to the plot: red = non-mastered, green = mastered, blue = unclassified
* see 2inprogress > AuxFunsAndPacks.R for packages required

cdcat.summary:

* CDM package accepted
* nonparametric CD-CAT accepted
* plots improved (e.g., without secondary grids)
